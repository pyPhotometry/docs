# Updated optical setup

Since the pyPhotometry manuscript was published Doric have updated their line of Photometry equipment, introducing minicubes with integrated LEDs and Photodetectors.  We have not tested these ourselves but from the information online it looks like they are a simpler and more convenient solution than the original optical setup which likely also gives better signal quality.  Below is a list of components for a red/green two-color system using the updated components.
